5-1 Newton's First and Second Laws (1 of 20)
Learning Objectives
5.01 Identify that a force is a vector quantity and thus has
both magnitude and direction and also components.
5.02 Given two or more forces acting on the same
particle, add the forces as vectors to get the net
force.
5.03 Identify Newton's first and second laws of motion.
5.04 Identify inertial reference frames.


5-1 Newton's First and Second Laws (2 of 20)
5.05 Sketch a free-body diagram for an object, showing
the object as a particle and drawing the forces acting
on it as vectors anchored to the particle.
5.06 Apply the relationship between net force on an
object, its mass, and the produced acceleration.
5.07 Identify that only external forces on an object can
cause the object to accelerate.


5-2 Some Particular Forces (1 of 15)
Learning Objectives
5.08 Determine the magnitude and direction of gravitational
force on a mass, for a given free-fall acceleration.
5.09 Identify that weight is the magnitude of the net force
required to prevent a body from falling freely, measured
by the frame of ground.
5.10 Identify that a scale gives an object’s weight when the
measurement is done in an inertial frame but not in an
accelerating frame, where it gives an apparent weight.


5-2 Some Particular Forces (2 of 15)
5.11 Determine the magnitude and direction of the normal
force on an object when the object is pressed or pulled
onto a surface.
5.12 Identify that the force parallel to the surface is a
frictional force that appears when the object slides or
attempts to slide.
5.13 Identify that a tension force is said to pull at both ends of
a cord (or a cord-like object) when the cord is taut.


5 Summary (1 of 4)
Newtonian Mechanics
• Forces are pushes or pulls
• Forces cause acceleration
Force
• Vector quantities
• 2 1 N 1 kg m/s =
• Net force is the sum of all forces on a body

5 Summary (2 of 4)
Newton's First Law
• If there is no net force on a body, the body remains at
rest if it is initially at rest, or moves in a straight line at
constant speed if it is in motion.
Inertial Reference Frames
• Frames in which Newtonian mechanics holds

Some Particular Forces
• Weight:
W mg =
Equation (5-12)
• Normal force from a surface
• Friction along a surface
• Tension in a cord
